## Project Description
Performing the analysis and visualization of the centrality network on educational data sets, to generate different types of random graphs representing social networks and to manipulate graph and subgraph structures, allowing you to share and gain insights into complex structures.

## Project Structure
### The project was carried out according to the following steps:

- Task 1: Load graphs from Excel spreadsheet files,
- Task 2: Visualize graphs with options and layouts,
- Task 3: Summarize graphs through centrality metrics,
- Task 4: Generate random graphs,
- Task 5: Add and remove nods and edges from graphs,
- Task 6: Manipulate nodes and edges attributes,
- Task 7: Create and visualize sub-graphs.
